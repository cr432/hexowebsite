What is WSL2?

Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) is a feature in Windows that allows users to run a Linux kernel on their Windows system. It provides better performance and full compatibility with Linux software, compared to WSL1.

WSL2 uses a lightweight virtual machine (VM) and offers improved file system performance. It is a great tool for developers who want the best of both Windows and Linux operating systems.

Benefits of WSL2

Full Linux Kernel: WSL2 includes a full Linux kernel built by Microsoft, allowing for system calls, compatibility with Linux applications, and better overall performance.
Improved File I/O Performance: WSL2 offers faster file system performance compared to WSL1, especially when dealing with heavy workloads.
Better Docker Integration: Since WSL2 uses a VM, Docker can run natively without requiring Docker Desktop, providing a smoother developer experience.
Low Resource Usage: Although WSL2 uses a VM, it is lightweight compared to traditional virtual machines and uses fewer system resources (RAM, CPU).
Seamless Windows Integration: You can access Windows files from the Linux environment, and vice versa. This allows you to work fluidly between both operating systems.
Key Features

Native Linux Kernel: Allows for greater compatibility with Linux tools and services.
Virtualized Environment: Runs a true Linux kernel using lightweight virtualization.
File System Support: Provides a fast and efficient file system for developers.
Memory Management: Dynamically uses system resources, scaling RAM usage up and down based on the workload.
System Requirements

Windows 10 Version 1903 or higher (Build 18362 or higher)
Windows 11 fully supports WSL2
Windows Hyper-V and Virtual Machine Platform must be enabled.
