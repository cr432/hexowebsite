## What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**. It automates the process of integrating code changes, testing, and deploying applications to production.

### Continuous Integration (CI)
CI is a development practice where developers integrate code changes into a shared repository multiple times a day. Each integration triggers an automated build and testing phase, ensuring that the codebase remains healthy.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
Continuous Deployment automates the process of releasing new code to production once it passes all the automated tests. This ensures faster delivery of updates and minimizes manual errors.

### Popular CI/CD Tools
- **Jenkins**: An open-source automation server for building and deploying projects.
- **GitLab CI**: Integrated directly into GitLab, it provides an easy way to set up CI/CD pipelines.
- **CircleCI**: A cloud-based tool that automates building, testing, and deploying code.

### Why CI/CD Matters in DevOps
- **Speeds Up Development**: CI/CD automates repetitive tasks, allowing teams to ship code faster.
- **Reduces Risk**: Automated testing ensures that bugs are caught early, reducing the risk of deployment failures.
- **Improves Collaboration**: Developers can work on different parts of a project simultaneously, knowing that their changes will be automatically tested and integrated.

### Setting Up a Simple CI/CD Pipeline (Example with GitLab CI)
1. **Define your pipeline in a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file**.
2. Specify stages like `build`, `test`, and `deploy`.
3. Use GitLab's built-in runners to execute your pipeline.
